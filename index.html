    <h2 class="pt5 lh1 fw9 fs6 green">What kind of documentation do you create?</h2>
    <p>Cultural? Scientific? Technical? Civic?</p>

    <p>All valid & important! While this project grows out of software documentation, the tools, practices, and goals of various types of documentation have overlap and folks can learn a great deal from working together in an interdisciplinary setting.</p>

    <p class="pt5 lh1 fw9 fs5 ns-fs-70 mt0">Let's take a day to focus on improving our documentation.</p>

    <h2 class="pt5 lh1 fw9 fs6 green">Coming to Seattle in April 2017!</h2>

    <h2 class="mt6 lh1 fw9 fs6 green">Who should attend?</h2>
    <p>Anyone working to improve the documentation for their project, creating tools for documentation, or folks interested in helping out and learning more about what it takes to write docs.</p>

    <h2 class="mt6 lh1 fw9 fs6 green">What will we do?</h2>
    <p>Docs Parties are more like a work party than hangout and socialize party (though that's a part of it too! Minus the booze!)</p>
    <p>We'll spend most of a day writing and editing documentation. We'll provide lunch, drinks, and snacks so you and your team can focus on improving your docs.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day we'll invite groups to give lightning talks about their projects and what they accomplished over the day.</p>

    <h2 class="mt5 lh1 fw6 fs4 green">Document your city</h2>
    <p>Civic and government technology need better documentation. Just knowing what city services exist can be a big challenge that can be addressed through documentation.</p>

    <h2 class="mt5 lh1 fw6 fs4 green">Document your code</h2>
    <p>It's easy to share code. It's not easy to share how to use it. We need great documentation for users of software to be effective.</p>

    <h2 class="mt5 lh1 fw6 fs4 green">Document your research</h2>
    <p>How is scientific data shared and how might it be documented in ways to make it more accessible?</p>

    <h2 class="mt5 lh1 fw6 fs4 green">Document your community</h2>
    <p>How might community organizations better document their processes, policies, and activities? Help make your community more effective by producing clear documentation.</p>

    <h2 class="mt6 lh1 fw9 fs6 green">Code of conduct</h2>
    <p>It's important that this project contributes to a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, particularly for folks that are historically underrepresented in technology.</p>
    <p class="mt4"><a href="/conduct" class="button">Read our code of conduct</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="sponsor" class="mt6 lh1 fw9 fs6 green">Sponsor Docs Party!</span></h2>
    <p>Support the production of quality documentation and help to build a documentation-focused community by sponsoring Docs Party! We need help covering space, food, and other costs of running the event.</p>

    <p><b>As a sponsor, you'll get:</b></p>
